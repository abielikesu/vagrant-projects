# vagrant-mssql-express

A Windows Server 2012 R2 VM with SQL Server Express 2014 powered by Vagrant.
This is a fork of [https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-mssql-express](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-mssql-express)

## Requirements

* Vagrant 1.6+ (tested on 1.6.3)
* VirtualBox 4.3+ (tested on 4.3.16 on an Ubuntu host)
* Around `12GB` of disk space (`3GB` for base box + `~9GB` for the VM)

## Base box information

* Configured with 2 CPU and 2 GB memory by default.
* No updates or services packs applied
* The box is not activated. It has been created for testing and evaluation
  purposes only. Use of this machine for greater than 30 days will require a
  full license either via MSDN or your local Microsoft Reseller.

More information can be found on the [box page at Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/opentable/boxes/win-2012r2-standard-amd64-nocm).

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leezu/vagrant-mssql-express.git
cd vagrant-mssql-express
# Download SQL Server with Tools installer
wget http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/A/E/EAE6F7FC-767A-4038-A954-49B8B05D04EB/ExpressAndTools%2064BIT/SQLEXPRWT_x64_ENU.exe
vagrant up
# Get a coffee as it will take a while for it to finish provisioning
```

Then test the connection with the SQL Server using `telnet 192.168.50.4 1433`


### Connecting to the SQL Server instance that runs inside the VM

* IP / Host: `192.168.50.4`
* Username: `sa`
* Password: `#SAPassword!`

If you are using Rails, apart from installing [tiny_tds](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds)
dependencies with `brew install freetds` / `apt-get install freetds-*` and
the [activerecord-sqlserver-adapter gem](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter),
this is what you'll have on your `database.yml`:

```yaml
development:
  adapter: sqlserver
  database: <YOUR DB>
  host: 192.168.50.4
  username: sa
  password: '#SAPassword!'
```

_More information on https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter/wiki/Using-TinyTDS_

An example [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) app can be found on [sinatra-app](sinatra-app).

### Connecting to the VM using [Remote Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol) connections

If you need to perform administrative tasks like importing a DB dump or creating
new databases, you can use the [`vagrant rdp` command](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/rdp.html)
and log in with the `vagrant` user and password.

For the `vagrant rdp` command to work on Ubuntu, you'll need to `apt-get install rdesktop`
first. I'm not sure what are the dependencies on Macs since I don't own one but
if you do [please let me know](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-mssql-express/issues/new)!
